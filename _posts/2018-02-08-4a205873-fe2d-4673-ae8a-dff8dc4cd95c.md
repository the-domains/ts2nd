Cooking with Dog is a YouTube cooking show featured by a canine host Francis and a mysterious Japanese Chef whose real name is not disclosed. While Chef cooks a variety of popular dishes in Japan, Francis calmly sits next to her and narrates the recipes step-by-step in English. He sometimes gets sleepy and closes his eyes but don't worry, you will still hear his voice. The show started in September, 2007\. Now it has more than 200 episodes and currently publishes a video every weekend. Enjoy Chef's authentic Japanese cooking skills and Francis' exotic Japanese accent.
